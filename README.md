# Syspro-Assignments-2021
Programming Projects in C for D.I.T Systems' Programming Course - K24. 

All data structures that are used in the project, are implemented by me.

The projects test and apply the following **programming paradigms**:
- Clean Code organization via source code modularity and prototype declaration
- (UNIX) Process programming and proper IPC techniques that allow better load management
- (UNIX) Socket programming basics, along with server and client processes creation to simulate a distributed load management in a local network  (tested only in one maching for now)
- (UNIX) Thread programming for basic functionalities, along with proper **mutex** and **condition variables** usage, to maintain atomicity while using the common memory resources, between the individual threads. 

For further explanation check the project readings (in greek) and/or the project documentation (in english).
